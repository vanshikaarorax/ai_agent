Within 28 days of the end of the contract, you can post a follow-up comment to a review about you that will show up on your public profile. You can also work directly with your client or AI to enable feedback changes and revise the review. If you feel the review violates Ai Genie’s terms of service and you would like to dispute a review, Ai Genie’s customer service team is there to help.
